## Who Are We? {#who}

Fandom Coders is a community where any adult in fandom—from total code newbies
to coding hobbyists to tech professionals—can share and discuss their coding
ambitions, find help getting started or unblocked, and learn new skills and
concepts.

Whatever you’re working on, we want to hear about it! From fans just learning
HTML for the first time, to those who want to create site themes or build a
personal web page, to those who want to create an app or dabble in data
analysis, to those who want to get involved with an open-source fandom project,
there’s a place for you in Fandom Coders.

Fandom Coders is also a great group to join for those considering picking up
some web development skills in the near future, those looking for their next
challenge, and anyone feeling stuck in their coding journey. Need a confidence
boost to reach for your coding dreams? We’ve got you covered.

own communities and software.**

In addition to Fandom Coders, the Fujoverse also includes the below open-source
coding libraries and community projects:
