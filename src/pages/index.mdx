## Who Are We?

_Fandom Coders is a community where tech professionals and coding
hobbyists alike can share and discuss their coding projects_
, find help getting started or unblocked, and learn new skills and
concepts. Among others goals, Fandom Coders aims to increase coding
literacy in fandom, and to connect fandom builders with each other to
create and shape the fandom internet they want to see.

_We welcome people of all experience levels and coding interests:_ from those
just getting started to those who have been in the tech
industry for years; from those who want to create site skins/themes or
build a personal web page, to those who want to create an app or
dabble in data analysis. Current favorite topics include Open Source
Software, decentralization, and the changing shape of fandom social
media.

This website serves as a member hub and a place to host our wiki; the
wiki is a group project of all of our members - a crowd-sourced
resource for fandom coders of varying levels. _We hope to provide
easy-to-follow tutorials and resources specifically tailored to the
needs of fandom people._
