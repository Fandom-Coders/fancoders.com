# Target audience

:::note
The goal of this document is to outline the target audience of our "introduction to webdev" guides.
Other "learning pathways" on this wiki may be tailored to different personas.
:::

## Audience goals

From our point of view, the goal of our webdev guides is to teach fandom people modern web development
techniques both to help them move their content out of walled gardens, and help them join (or create)
web projects that target the needs of other fandom folks.

From the audience point of view, their goals may be to create:

- A shrine to their OTP or their favorite series
- A wiki/info page for an event they're running
- An "about me" page, similar to linktree/carrd websites
- A gallery of content they've created (e.g. art, fanfic or meta)
- A custom AO3/Dreamwidth/Tumblr skin
- Custom elements for websites that accept HTML (e.g. a "fake tweet" within their fanfiction)

Non-goals (for now):

- Self-hosting
- Backend development

## Audience characteristics

- Roughly in the 25-40 years old age range, that is millenials/Gen X'ers who may have been on the web
  in the late 90s/early 00s. Can understand written English.
- Have full lives outside of coding, and splintered slivers of free time.
- May be neuroatypical, and have anxiety or trauma exacerbated by feeling unwelcomed or rejected
  by traditional learning institutions or group settings. May have attention regulation problems,
  and get easily distracted or hyperfocus.
- None to beginner knowledge of web technologies. They may have dabbled in HTML/CSS in the olden days,
  but have out-of-date knowledge. They may have used carrd, wix, or other "website builder" technologies.
  We assume no pre-existing knowledge of JavaScript.
- Likely Windows user. We assume access to at least a laptop.
- Are curious about programming, but may have an underlying anxiety about "not being cut for it". They likely
  feel overwhelmed by the existing "learn to program" offerings.
- May feel that they have no use for "advanced programming technologies" (e.g. git), and be fearful/skeptical
  of anything beyond "editing simple text files".
  ----- REDISCUSS
- Likely to be "financially challenged", or otherwise resistant to spending money on software. They may go to
  great lengths to avoid paid software, unless the value provided (for example in terms of time saved) is
  overwhelmingly clear. Their income levels may tend to fluctuate, and when they spend money, some may tend
  to prefer one-time payments or a lump sum for a yearly suprscriptions. Conversely, others may feel anxious
  longer-term commitments to paid services. Some may be from non-US countries with lower buying power, and may
  benefit from region-based pricing. Regardless, they feel more comfortable supporting smaller services than
  big corporations, especially providers that are well-known in the community and offer direct communication.

## Audience needs

General questions that our audience may have include:

- What is web development? Can I be a "web developer" if I only want to learn how to build simple websites?
- Am I capable of learning web development? What will I need to effectively learn it? Which languages will
  I need to learn?
- Is learning web development fun? Is it going to be easy or hard? How much time will it take to reach [X] goal?
- Can I learn web development and create my own websites for free?
- Will these guides be useful for me if I don't want to become a professional web developer? Will these guides
  be useful to me if I'm considering a professional career?
- How does modern webdev differ from the webdev of the 00s? Has it gotten harder or easier?
- Is it normal to be overwhelmed by the endless stream of keywords/terminology? Is it normal to find most
  explanations out there overwhelming and confusing? Does this mean I'm not cut out for web development?
- How long will it take for me to learn web development? Is the road meant to be so full of up and downs?
- Where can I go if I have questions? Will that place be welcoming to me?
- Why should I learn the technologies in this guide? Why should I use the software you recommend? Why should I
  trust you?

Specific questions that our audience may have include:

- Where do I type code? What do I use to write code?
- Where do I store my code? Why should I use git(hub)?
- What are package managers (npm, yarn)? Why should I use them?

- How do I structure my content? How do I organize my files? How do I reference file paths in my code?
- How can I ensure my content works on different browsers and at different sizes? How can I make sure
  my content is accessible to all users?
- How should I handle images?
- How do I reuse layout elements across different pages?
- How do I add interactivity to my website?
- How can I install and use external packages?
- What is a framework? What is a component (and props)? What is JSX? What is MDX?
