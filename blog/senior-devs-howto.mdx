# How to Help & Get Help

If you're diving into the world of programming for the first time, or making the jump from hobbyist
to "junior professional", it's easy to get intimated by more senior developers. Indeed, while often
well-intentioned, senior developers often suffer from a condition which causes them to forget how it
feels to be a junior engineer facing their first challenges, or makes it hard for them to tailor
their questions and replies to varying levels of experience.

If you're a beginner, this article is here to convince you of a simple (but sometimes hard to
believe) truth: _it's not you, it's them_. I hope that, armed with this newfound knowledge, you'll
be able to advocate for better-tailored help, and feel empowered to push back against non useful
advice.

## It's not you, it's them (I swear)

One of the greatest challenges of being a beginner is that it might hard to understand whether
you're being obtuse or an explanation is bad.

- if i was ever confused or stuck or whatever to let you know, because it was the fault of the
  explanation/documentation

- what the senior person is telling me is obvious to them and it should be obvious to me too, and if
  I can't understand it then it means I must not be good at programming

- They might be stating it as obvious cause they have a hard time gauging what should be. It's their
  problem.

- junior developers are in a vulnerable position because they can't counter your claims with their
  level or knowledge, so you need to be careful about explaining where your reasoning is coming from

- it takes effort from both sides to be able to get the most out of learning from eachother

## The illusion of expertise

- the leading attitude should always be of "curiosity", and one should remember that while they
  might have less practical experience junior devs offer fresh perspectives that are valuable (for
  example bc they are unburdened by we-always-did-it-this-way assumptions)

- Programming is an incredible vast field with multidisciplinary influences, and it's impossible to
  know everything. Acknowledging the limits of your expertise can go a long way in helping beginners
  feel confident that is ok not to know everything.

- It didn't use to be obvious to them, and a lot of things that are obvious to others are not
  obvious to them at all either

- There are so many paths in programming and it's hard to know someone's relative level

- Expertise is knowing what to Google
- The reason senior devs might solve bugs quicker than you is not because they're smarter, but
  because they're more experienced

  - They most likely have made the same error 15 times
  - Programming can be very rewarding and very frustrating. Everyone has given up sometimes.

- Domain expertise vs general expertise
  - You might know more than a senior dev on something!

### The risks of jargon

- jargon makes explanations simpler for senior devs, but can make explanations harder for junior
  devs. Try to tailor your language, but regardless ask for explanations.

- (seniors) Before using jargon, try ensure that the junior dev knows what that jargon means
- (juniors) If the senior dev uses jargon you don't understand, and it's impacting your ability to
  follow the discussion, ask them to clarify cause they might not realize you don't (and it's ok
  that you don't)

- as a senior dev I also feel bad being like, "do you know what a [basic concept] is?" too often,
  cause people can feel like you're asking because you think they aren't good enough to know [basic
  concept]? but there's a lot of basic concepts I also don't know as an expert
- apple has a general bit of advice which is like "don't use jargon but do use terms of art" the
  dividing line is like, what would be most useful to search on stackoverflow

## Good code does not exist (only "better" one)

- i feel like "opinions are important but clearly delineate them from facts" is a good bit of advice
- it's fine to express an opinion and i think junior devs should respect those opinions but
  oftentimes i think they take them as stronger than they are, like if i do $x EVER that means i'm
  BAD and a TERRIBLE PROGRAMMER, no, it's in the language for a reason, it just has some drawbacks
  so maybe try this other way instead

  - (junior dev) Senior devs often have strong opinions, some of which have been passed down to them
    by other senior devs, and some of which they have developed through the years. While there's a
    lot you can learn from these opinions, there can be a lot more depth and nuance to the issue
    than you (or even the senior dev) are aware of. It's fine to ask clarifications on the reasoning
    behind a statement, and to take even "widely accepted practices" with a grain of salt.
  - remember that no one has written good code like ever
  - industry standard != best practices, is the argument i recently got into lol
    - here's more at play in a non-hobby environment that's gonna guide what's common and not.
      usually money and time are gonna be big factors, needing to hire a specialist might not be
      feasible but maybe hyperfocusing on something for 8 months straight is for someone with a cool
      brain. the industry standard is gonna prioritize and balance different things that a hobby
      coder maybe doesn't care about or that are irrelevant to them... so being transparent when
      giving advice is good. and being clear about what is and isnt important to you is as well
  - "if someone makes general disparaging statements about programmers, that's most likely a they
    problem, it's not about you" or I guess "sometimes people make those strong statements in
    frustration, pls don't take them seriously"
  - "you have the right to mess up, and actually you will mess up, so don't try to prevent that at
    all time cause no one can"

- As a junior dev you have the right to push back and say "this isn't useful!"

## It's all about your goals

- Senior devs love to infodump
- and I think many senior devs (or at least me, i'm super guilty here) love programming so they have
  a tendency to want to teach people good practices etc. cause they love talking about, and I think
  that's valuable but not for everyone
  - (junior devs) It's ok to push back on too technical or too in depth explanations and say, "thank
    you, but I'm only seeking to [solve this specific use case? get this thing done then go play
    videogames?] today"
- (senior devs) Before launching into a long-winded explanation with someone you have no
  pre-existing rapport with, try asking questions about their goals
- I do think we should make some allowances there for "if someone is a regular and you know they
  love in-depth explanations you don't need to ask all the time"

- (senior dev) remember that best practices in a professional environment might be overkill or not
  relevant to hobbyists. Consider the person's goals when you're giving advice.
- for junior devs, part of me wants to say "remember that senior devs often come from industry, and
  that industry often optimizes for long-term maintainability, ability to grow to many users, and
  many people working on the same program. While you might want to learn about these practices, they
  might not be relevant to your personal projects. Feel free to ask the senior dev "do you think I
  should use my time on fixing this [for the project I'm doing now]?"

## You are welcome here

- it is intimidating if people are talking shop and you're standing there like "can someone help me
  center this div? " and at the same time, you have all the problems of a regular discord server
  where people imagine cliques or that they're not welcome to join the conversation.

Goals of this article:

- Guide senior developers on how to keep discussions welcoming to junior developers
- Guide senior developers on how to effectively give advice to junior developers
- Help junior developers understand the blindspots senior developers might have during discussions
- Help junior developers feel confident asking for clarifications when needed
- Help junior developers feel confident setting boundaries when discussion isn't being helpful
