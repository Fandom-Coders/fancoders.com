# Learn to edit the wiki

## Overview 

This page is a summary of a thread from the Fandom Coders discord server in which a few members went over how to make edits to this wiki.

### What this page will teach you:

- How to make a fork of a github repository (if you haven't been added as a collaborator to that repository)
- How to branch a repository in github
- How to make edits to a branch using an online workspace such as gitpod.io 
- Recommendations on offline editing software (as an alternative to an online/remote editing environment like gitpod)
- Types of files used in this wiki
- Syntax for the file types used in this wiki

### Some git vocabulary you will need to know:

- *Git* - git is a version control system for making edits to code. Github is the most well-known website for storing projects that are edited/versioned using git.
- *Repository* - a name for the code base you are editing, forking, or branching from to make edits.
- *Fork* - a fork is a copy of a repository, like a snapshot, taken at a certain time, which can then be edited separately from the main/original repository.
- *Branch* - branches can be made within forks; branches are where edits are made without changing the original code base, and can be "merged" back into the original code base using a commit & pull request.
- *Commit* - every time you save the changes you've made with git/github to the branch or fork you are working on, you are making a commit. Usually several changes are committed at once; you "stage" changes to include them in a commit.
- *Pull request* - a pull request is the request to merge a commit (or a package of edits/changes) with the original fork or original repository for the code. This is how changes to the code are finalized and incorporated.

If you'd like a fairly simple explanation of git and how it works, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/what-is-git" target="_blank">this</a> is a good place to start.

### Some wiki vocabulary and info you will need to know:

- *Docusaurus* - a static site generator. This is what is used to make the Fandom Coders website. You can learn more about it <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
- *.MDX* - this is a file type used in the wiki. The page you're reading right now is an .MDX file! MDX stands for "MarkDown & JSX," which are the two types of code that can be used in an .MDX file. JSX is similar to HTML, so most simple HTML tags can be used in an .MDX file, such as hyperlink tags (as with the above links).
- *Markdown* - a text markup language; you may be familiar with MarkDown, especially if you already know some HTML, but if you want more information about it, check out <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/448323/what-is-markdown-and-how-do-you-use-it/" target="_blank">this</a> page or <a href="https://commonmark.org/help/" target="_blank">this</a> page for some common MarkDown syntax.
- *.MD* - a MarkDown file. You'll find some of these in the wiki.
- *.JS* - a JavaScript file. You'll find these in the Fandom Coders site as well, but we won't cover how to edit them in this tutorial. To learn more about JS, you can check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank">this</a> page.
- *.JSON* - a JavaScript Object Notation file. As above, these are used in this website, but we won't cover editing them here. For more info on JSON, see <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp" target ="_blank">this</a> page.

If you have any questions about other file types or languages used in the website and/or wiki, try googling them! This is only a few!
