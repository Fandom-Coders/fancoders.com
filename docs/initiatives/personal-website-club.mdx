## Overview

Members of the *Personal Website Club* meet periodically to work on their personal websites.

While there is no specific agenda for the club's meetings, members gather together to collectively work, cheer and help each other, or to get accountability for the progress they wish to make.

Since Fandom Coders experienced in web development are often present during Personal Website Club days, they can be the perfect occasions for beginners to get some focused practice and support.

All Fandom Coders members are welcome to participate in Personal Website Club days, regardless of role assignment.

## Scheduled *Personal Website Club* days

Officially, the Personal Website Club meets every [week, two weeks, month] on [day of the week], and each event runs all day to accomodate members from different time zones.

## Scheduling a *Personal Website Club* day outside the regular schedule

There are two types of Personal Website Club events:

- **Scheduled:** These days are organized in advance and added to the Discord event calendar. 
- **Impromptu:** Members who want to work on their own personal website can simply declare such a day and see if others want them to join on their endeavor. You can declare an impromptu Website Club meeting in the *personal_website_club* channel on the Discord server by simply announcing it.

**Name of site:** [cmdonovann on neocities](https://cmdonovann.neocities.org/)

**Name of site creator:** CMDonovann

**Description:** This is my art site, as well as a kind of central hub for links to other places to find me online and projects I work on. I've worked on redesigning it once or twice during the website club, as well as designing some css for fanfic pages on the site that I haven't actually put into use yet! >_<

**Name of site:** [quantumbreak.neocities.org](https://quantumbreak.neocities.org/)

**Name of site creator:** CMDonovann

**Description:** This is a fansite for my favorite video game, *Quantum Break* (2016). It's currently a work in progress, but recently I've been using the website club as an excuse to mess around with css for a work-in-progress fanfiction archive, as well as a gallery of icons featuring characters from the game. You can find its GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/cmdonovann/quantumbreak-neocities)

**Tools:** I use VSCode as an editor, and use [this](https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities) "deploy to Neocities" tool from GitHub for both my sites.

**Host:** Neocities
