# Our Initiatives

This work in progress section of the wiki outlines some of the recurring events we run
in our discord server.

## Joining an initiative

Every member is encouraged to get involved in events they see happening in the server. There is
generally no obligation to RSVP before joining (though RSVPs are appreciated).

A Discord role is associated with each initiative. Joining the role will keep you
notified of when new events are scheduled.

## Creating an initiative

Members are encouraged to create their own initiatives. We don't currently have a formal process,
but will provide support as needed.
